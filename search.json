But a linear predictor does not always capture the relationship we wish to model. Rather, a nonlinear predictor may provide a better description of the observed data, often with fewer and more interpretable parameters. This workshop introduces the wider class of generalized nonlinear models (GNMs) and their implementation via the R package gnm. The day will begin with a brief refresher of linear and generalized linear models. The extension to a nonlinear predictor will be motivated by the case of structured interaction models, such as Goodman’s Row-Column association model for contingency tables. The remainder of the day will be devoted to further applications, such as the UNIDIFF models for social mobility data, the Lee-Carter model for mortality data, and bespoke GNMs.\n\nRequirements\nParticipants should\n\nbring a laptop with R installed, along with the gnm, logmult and vcdExtra packages.\nhave basic R knowledge (e.g. you have used R to load data, create simple visualisations, perform basic analyses and write simple functions or more specifically, you are familiar with concepts in Cookbook for R by Winston Chang)\nknow basic statistics (e.g. simple linear regression, hypothesis testing, basic summary statistics and plots)\n\n\n\nDesirable\nFamiliarity with:\n\ngeneralized linear models and/or\nnonlinear least squares models\n\nwould be beneficial but not essential.\n\n\nBiography\nHeather is an Associate Professor and EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow in the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick, UK. She has over 20 years of experience in the development of statistical code and software, gained through positions in academia, industry, and as a freelance consultant. In research, she has developed a portfolio of R packages for statistical modelling and collaborated on applications in sports, social science and agriculture. In her work with industry, she has specialised in applications in pharmaceutical R&D, with companies including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Roche. Heather is active in community management and engagement among R users and developers. She is on the board of the R Foundation and chairs the R Contribution Working Group (fostering the community of contributors to the R project) and the R Forwards taskforce (widening the participation of under-represented groups in the R community)."

Recent work on saddlepoint approximations has helped to quantify the degree to which approximation techniques can deliver valid inferential conclusiosn, and to extend classes of models to capture real-life complexity in capture-recapture and other settings that feature enigmatic sensor data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMevin Hooten\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMevin Hooten is a Professor in Statistics and Data Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin.
