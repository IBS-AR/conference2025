One factor that cannot be anticipated in advance is the size of the incursion at the time of its detection. Unfortunately, the impact of an incursion is tightly tied to its maturity at detection, ranging from a single seed, for example, to a 50,000 hectare infestation of plants.\nWe propose a simple probability model for the detection of an invasive species that can either capture or integrate out the consequent uncertainty of the maturity of the incursion. We represent the relationship between surveillance and the detection of the organism using survival analysis: the detection of the incursion is analogous to the survival event; it is a binary occurrence that happens at some point in time, and once it has happened it does not happen again.\nUnder such a model, we can connect the distribution of the size of the infestation at the time to detection to the probability of detecting the incursion given that it has not already been detected, namely, the hazard function. For example, a popular model for the detection of an incursion of size x with number of traps t and probability of detecting a single pest \\(p\\) is:\n\\(h(x,t,p) = 1 - (1 - p)^{tx}\\)\nAlgebra leads us to a size-at-detection pdf. Other corrections are also applied as needed. The outcome is a pdf that is a function of process parameters, enabling straightforward assessment of different surveillance choices. Parameter estimates for the distribution can be derived from first principles, field experiments, or expert elicitation.\nIn this presentation we will derive and demonstrate the use of the survival-based incursion size at detection pdf and discuss its implications and challenges.\n\n\n\nDr Mahdi Parsa and Dr Belinda Barnes\nDepartment of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry\n“Optimal allocation of resources between control and surveillance for complex eradication scenarios”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective eradication of invasive species over large areas requires strategic allocation of resources between control measures and surveillance activities. This study presents an analytical Bayesian framework that integrates stochastic modelling and explicit measures of uncertainty to guide decisions in complex eradication scenarios. By applying Shannon entropy to quantify uncertainty and incorporating the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), the framework identifies conditions under which investment into control or surveillance becomes worthwhile. Findings show that strategies which hedge against uncertainty can markedly improve the robustness of eradication outcomes with only marginal increases in expected costs. This approach offers practical tools for designing more cost-effective and reliable eradication programs and for prioritising data collection to reduce uncertainty where it has the greatest impact.\n\n\n\nDr Sumon Das and A/Prof Robert Clark\nAustralian National University\n“Bayesian clustered ensemble prediction for multivariate time series”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup testing plays a vital role in biosecurity operations worldwide, particularly in minimising the risk of introducing exotic pests, contaminants, and pathogens through imported agricultural products. A common screening strategy involves pooling items from consignments and testing each group for contamination presence, with consignments typically rejected if any group tests positive. Although screening designs often target a high probability of detection assuming a fixed minimum prevalence, analysing the historical results of these tests to infer the extent of contamination in non-rejected consignments (referred to as leakage) is less common.\nThis study advances censored beta-binomial (BB) models to address contamination risk in frozen seafood imports into Australia, incorporating imperfect tests. Motivated by the characteristics of our case study, we develop a new class of BB models that impose a minimum positive consignment propensity threshold, capturing scenarios where contamination is either absent or exceeds a known minimum level. To fit these models, we propose a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm conditioned on prior distributions for sensitivity and specificity, allowing efficient estimation of quantities related to contamination levels. We analyse historical testing data under multiple scenarios using the proposed MH algorithm, yielding novel insights into both contamination risk and leakage.\nFinally, we use model-based simulations to communicate risk levels, providing key insights into potential undetected contamination.\n\n\n\nDr Raphael Trouvé\nUniversity of Melbourne, Senior Research Fellow in Forest Dynamics\n“Optimal sampling in border biosecurity”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder biosecurity faces mounting pressure from increasing global trade, requiring cost-effective inspection strategies to reduce the risk of importing pest and diseases. Current international standards recommend inspecting all incoming consignments (full census) with fixed sample sizes (e.g., 600 units) for high-risk pathways, but this may be overkill for lower-risk pathways with established compliance records. When should agencies use skip-lot sampling (SLS, sometimes called continuous sampling plan), which adaptively reduces inspections based on recent compliance history, over full census inspection?\nWe developed a propagule pressure equation for SLS in overdispersed pathways and used Lagrange multipliers to derive a solution. Results show the choice depends on pathway overdispersion, sampling costs, and budget constraints. Optimal sample sizes are typically smaller than current recommendations, with better returns from inspecting a larger proportion of consignments rather than larger samples per consignment. This framework provides biosecurity agencies with data-driven guidance for implementing adaptive sampling strategies."

Despite the plethora of presence-only occurrence data available for biodiversity analysis, there remain few examples of presence-only multiple-species modelling approaches. We present a mixture-of-regressions model for understanding how groups of species are distributed based on presence-only data. Our approach extends Species Archetype Models using a point process framework and incorporates joint estimation of sighting bias based on all species occurrences included in the model. We demonstrate that our method can accurately recapture mean and variance of parameters from simulated data sets and provide better estimates than those generated from multiple single species presence-only species distribution models. We apply our approach to a Myrtaceae presence-only occurrence dataset from New South Wales, Australia. We show that presence-only Species Archetype Models allow for the propagation of variance and uncertainty from the data through predictions, improving inference made on presence-only biodiversity data for multiple species.\n\n\n\nDr Louise McMillian\nSchool of Mathematics and Statistics, Victoria University of Wellington\n“The difficulties of clustering categorical or mixed data”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nI will discuss techniques for clustering categorical data that go beyond treating the data as numerical or converting the categories to dummy variables.

MBPS combines a set of predictive models and partitions the multiple time series into clusters based on their contribution to predicting the outcome. In this way MBPS leverages the shared information within each cluster and avoids using a multivariate count model, which is generally cumbersome to develop and implement. Our data analyses demonstrate that the proposed MBPS methodology has improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification."

In this study, we predict the cattle’s daily weight gain from five core cattle behaviours and a measure of total daily activity based on accelerometer data. To collect data, we conducted an experiment equipping a herd of 60 Brahman steers with research collars containing triaxial accelerometers over nearly one month in Australia. We used the accelerometer data, which represents the intensity of animal movement, to compute an activity metric within a five-minute window. In addition, we use pre-trained accelerometer-based machine learning models to classify cattle behaviour into grazing, ruminating, resting, walking, drinking or other classes over five-second time windows. Daily behaviour profiles were constructed for each animal and experiment day by aggregating the behaviour predictions over every calendar day. Our objective was to explore how to use behaviours and activity metrics to predict the cattle’s daily weight gain. The daily activity values ranging from 5.44g to 23.69g. The average daily time spent grazing, ruminating, resting, walking and drinking was 8.97±1.12, 7.78 ±1.03, 5.83±1.05, 1.00±0.4, and 0.18±0.12 hours, respectively. Some weather information data are combined in the model to predict the cattle live-weight gain. The best R-squared value is 0.467, with a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.867 from the linear regression model. The live-weight gain could not be fully explained by measurements taken in this study, but we showed how these factors can influence the variability in cattle performance.\n\n\n\nA/Prof Gota Morota\nUniveristy of Tokyo\n“Evaluating the impact of trait measurement error on genetic analysis of computer vision-based phenotypes”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative genetic analysis of image- or video-derived phenotypes is increasingly being performed for a wide range of traits. Pig body weight values estimated by a conventional approach or a computer vision system can be considered as two different measurements of the same trait, but with different sources of phenotyping error. Previous studies have shown that trait measurement error, defined as the difference between manually collected phenotypes and image-derived phenotypes, can be influenced by genetics, suggesting that the error is systematic rather than random and is more likely to lead to misleading quantitative genetic analysis results. Therefore, we investigated the effect of trait measurement error on genetic analysis of pig body weight (BW). Calibrated scale-based and image-based BW showed high coefficients of determination and goodness of fit. Genomic heritability estimates for scale-based and image-based BW were mostly identical across growth periods. Genomic heritability estimates for trait measurement error were consistently negligible, regardless of the choice of computer vision algorithm. In addition, genome-wide association analysis revealed no overlap between the top markers identified for scale-based BW and those associated with trait measurement error. Overall, the deep learning-based regressions outperformed the adaptive thresholding segmentation methods. This study showed that manually measured scale-based and image-based BW phenotypes yielded the same quantitative genetic results. We found no evidence that BW trait measurement error could be influenced, at least in part, by genetic factors. This suggests that trait measurement error in pig BW does not contain systematic errors that could bias downstream genetic analysis.\n\n\n\nDr Elle Saber\nAustralian National University\n“Fishing for Heritability in the Gill Microbiome: Why Statisticians Should get out into the field”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nHost‐associated microbiomes are increasingly recognised as integral to health, yet the extent to which host genetics shapes these communities remains unclear. While heritable components of gut and skin microbiomes have been documented in several vertebrates, evidence for the gill microbiome of fish is scarce. This exploratory study sampled the gill microbiome of Atlantic salmon within a Tasmanian breeding program to investigate potential genetic influences. Despite careful planning, study participants did not always behave, and the practical constraints of a commercial operation prevented complete data capture. Having participated in the data collection I was better prepared to understand the limitations of the dataset when doing the downstream analysis. The take home message is that, even if we feel like a fish out of water, time spent among the data can be just as valuable as time spent our desks."

But a linear predictor does not always capture the relationship we wish to model. Rather, a nonlinear predictor may provide a better description of the observed data, often with fewer and more interpretable parameters. This workshop introduces the wider class of generalized nonlinear models (GNMs) and their implementation via the R package gnm. The day will begin with a brief refresher of linear and generalized linear models. The extension to a nonlinear predictor will be motivated by the case of structured interaction models, such as Goodman’s Row-Column association model for contingency tables. The remainder of the day will be devoted to further applications, such as the UNIDIFF models for social mobility data, the Lee-Carter model for mortality data, and bespoke GNMs.\n\nRequirements\nParticipants should\n\nbring a laptop with R installed, along with the gnm, logmult and vcdExtra packages.\nhave basic R knowledge (e.g. you have used R to load data, create simple visualisations, perform basic analyses and write simple functions or more specifically, you are familiar with concepts in Cookbook for R by Winston Chang)\nknow basic statistics (e.g. simple linear regression, hypothesis testing, basic summary statistics and plots)\n\n\n\nDesirable\nFamiliarity with:\n\ngeneralized linear models and/or\nnonlinear least squares models\n\nwould be beneficial but not essential.\n\n\nBiography\nHeather is an Associate Professor and EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow in the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick, UK.

She has drawn a focus to ethics and social impact related to technology developments through various initiatives and is a key driver for equity and diversity in the context of research and internationalization. Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, Dr. Dean served as the Dean of Science at Western University from 2011 to 2017. She also played a major role in establishing the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University, as the Associate Dean of that Faculty, and was the founding Chair of the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at Simon Fraser University. Dr. Dean has been awarded numerous honours for her work including Fellowships with the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the Fields Institute, the American Statistical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2023, she was awarded the Statistical Society of Canada Gold Medal. In 2024, she was bestowed the rank of Chevalier in the prestigious Ordre des Palmes académiques by the French government for her work advancing research connections between Canada and France. Additionally, Dr. Dean has held several editorships and served in numerous leadership roles internationally and nationally, related to equity and inclusion, statistics and data science, research, and computing infrastructure. In Canada, she served as President of the Statistical Society of Canada and serves on several Boards of Directors.

It is not unusual that we become accustomed to vertical thinking whereby we use existing tools and methods in our own specialty to problem solve, losing sight of the larger interdisciplinary context of data science, and the context of the scientific challenge. The Government of Canada - Science and Technology branch has identified several priority research challenge topics that involve cross-disciplinary work. Although statistical tools and analytics are identified in these research challenge priority areas, additionally, the development of fundamental transformative and enabling technological tools specifically for statistical methods and analytics to support research and societal advancement is also seen as a priority. This talk shares insights about the challenges and opportunities for statistics in interdisciplinary research. Specifically, monitoring viral signals in wastewater and assessing forest fire risk are given as complex, case studies that use a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to solve difficult problems. This approach will demonstrate the significant benefits for not only optimizing research impact but for training students to become horizontal problem solvers across a wide range of research methods which will benefit them in navigating complex problems and in the development of appropriate tools for their analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharmaine Dean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Charmaine Dean (Ph.D., University of Waterloo) is Vice-President, Research and International at the University of Waterloo.

She has over 20 years of experience in the development of statistical code and software, gained through positions in academia, industry, and as a freelance consultant. In research, she has developed a portfolio of R packages for statistical modelling and collaborated on applications in sports, social science and agriculture. In her work with industry, she has specialised in applications in pharmaceutical R&D, with companies including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Roche. Heather is active in community management and engagement among R users and developers. She is on the board of the R Foundation and chairs the R Contribution Working Group (fostering the community of contributors to the R project) and the R Forwards taskforce (widening the participation of under-represented groups in the R community).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUses of gnm for Generalized (Non)linear Modelling\n\n\nThe R package {gnm} was designed as a unified interface to fit Generalized Nonlinear Models: generalized to handle responses with restricted range and/or a variance that depends on the mean, and nonlinear to allow the predictor for the mean to be nonlinear in its parameters. This framework covers several models that were proposed in the literature and adopted in practice before {gnm} was released, but used to require a mixed bag of specialised software to fit.\nWith {gnm} celebrating its 20th birthday this year, it’s a good time to review how the package is being used. I’ll highlight some of the applications we were aware of when {gnm} was first developed, that remain in common use, and explore more recent applications, particularly in the field of biometrics.\nWe’ll discover one motivation for using {gnm}, is for the ““eliminate”” feature that efficiently estimates stratification parameters. This can be useful even when the predictor is linear, as in the case of using conditional Poisson models to analyse case-crossover studies in epidemiology. We’ll also look at two of the packages that have built on {gnm}. The first, {multgee}, uses {gnm} to fit multiplicative interactions for certain correlation structures when modelling categorical data, with applications in public health, agriculture, and psychology. The second, {VFP}, is a more specialised package that uses {gnm} to model the mean-variance relationship for in-vitro diagnostic assays.\nThrough these use cases we’ll see how different features of {gnm} can be applied, demonstrating the versatility of this software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather Turner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather is an Associate Professor and EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow in the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick, UK.

He began his academic career in mathematical probability, using distributional approximations and large deviations techniques to understand random geometric structures, and increasingly looking at statistical models that exhibit probabilistic complexity. His research focuses on asymptotic techniques, particularly when several asymptotic effects interact or compete, in areas from branching processes and spatial structures to approximations for likelihoods and densities. Recent work on saddlepoint approximations has helped to quantify the degree to which approximation techniques can deliver valid inferential conclusiosn, and to extend classes of models to capture real-life complexity in capture-recapture and other settings that feature enigmatic sensor data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaddlepoint approximations for likelihoods\n\n\nClassically, the saddlepoint approximation has been used as a systematic method for converting a known generating function into an approximation for an unknown density function. More recently, it has been used instead as an approximation to the likelihood function. In this viewpoint, it is the underlying data-generating process whose generating function is used, and the saddlepoint approximation can be maximized to compute an approximate saddlepoint MLE for given observed data. This talk will explain how the saddlepoint approximation can be interpreted with a statistical lens, including common features for those otherwise intractable models where we can compute a generating function but not a likelihood. Many of these models come from statistical ecology, including sitations where we gather population-wide observations only. In addition, the talk will describe a class of models having simple theoretical guarantees for the effect of using the saddlepoint MLE as a substitute for the unknown true MLE, and will demonstrate new tools to visualize the saddlepoint approximation intuitively, to simplify and automate the computation of saddlepoint MLEs, and to quantitatively assess the amount of approximation error introduced by using an approximate likelihood as a substitute for an intractable true likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJesse Goodman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJesse Goodman is a Senior Lecturer in Statistics at the University of Auckland.

His research focuses on developing statistical methodology for ecological and environmental applications that involve spatial and spatio-temporal data. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association (ASA) and received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the ASA section on statistics and the environment. He has authored over 185 papers and 3 textbooks and serves as Associate Editor for Biometrics, Environmetrics, and JABES.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModularizing Biometric Models Facilitates Multistage Computing\n\n\nBayesian modeling has become invaluable in biometrics. It allows us to formally consider unobserved processes while accommodating uncertainty about data collection and our understanding of biological and ecological mechanisms. Several excellent software packages are available for fitting Bayesian models to data and are being applied every day to analyze biometric data. These methods allow us to answer questions using data in ways that has never before been possible. The adoption of Bayesian methods has led to bigger models necessary to answer tough questions using large and varied data sets. Bigger models and data sets lead to computing bottlenecks. Fortunately, a solution to Bayesian computing roadblocks sits in plain sight. The structure of Bayesian models allows us to rearrange them so that we can perform computing in stages. We can break big models into pieces, fit them separately, and then recombine them in later computing stages. Recursive Bayesian approaches can save us time by leveraging the parallel architecture of modern computers. A modular perspective allows us to see Bayesian models in a way that facilitates multistage computing. I will demonstrate the procedure with a set of biometric examples. These include geostatistical models in marine science, capture-recapture models for abundance estimation, and spatial point process models for species distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMevin Hooten\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMevin Hooten is a Professor in Statistics and Data Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin.

The regional conference is the prime destination for Australasian statistics and data science in the biosciences. Society has a rich history rooted in statistical theory, methodology and practice. More recent advancements attract diverse skills that span into data science.\nWith only a maximum of two parallel sessions, the conference offers an intimate gathering of biometricians, statisticians, data scientists and alike in the Australasian region. The conference gives a prime opportunity to network with the regional biometrics community.\nBelow are photos from past conferences. Photo credit: Hans Hockey."
