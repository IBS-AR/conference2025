The [International Biometric Society (IBS)](https://www.biometricsociety.org/) is devoted to the development and application of statistical and mathematical theory and methods in the Biosciences, including agriculture, biomedical science and public health, ecology, environmental sciences, forestry, and allied disciplines. It welcomes as members statisticians, mathematicians, biological scientists, and others devoted to interdisciplinary efforts in advancing the collection and interpretation of information in the biosciences.

The IBS is organised into geographically-defined regions, each with at least 50 members. [The Australasian Region (IBS-AR)](https://biometricsociety.org.au/) is one of over 30 regions under the IBS umbrella. It provides to members of the IBS who reside in Australia, New Zealand and nearby countries a local focus and support for biometrics undertaken in this region.

The Australasian Region Biometrics conference is a biannual conference sponsored by the IBS-AR. The conference is a forum for biometricians, statisticians, and those interested in the development and application of statistical and mathematical theory and methods to problems in the biosciences. The conference is open to members and non-members of the Society.
