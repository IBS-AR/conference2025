With computational methods like AI promising accurate predictions, we revisit the question of adaptively designing new measurements that take previous data into account.

Then we discuss potential impacts on choosing measurements in spatiotemporal problems.

However, achieving these desirable properties depends on correctly specifying the stable threshold parameter, which can be challenging. An arbitrary choice of this parameter can substantially alter the set of selected variables, as the variables' selection probabilities are inherently data-dependent. To address this issue, we propose Exclusion Automatic Threshold Selection (EATS), a data-adaptive algorithm that streamlines stability selection by automating the threshold specification process. EATS initially filters out potential noise variables using an exclusion probability threshold, derived from applying stability selection to a randomly shuffled version of the dataset. Following this, EATS selects the stable threshold parameter using the elbow method, balancing the marginal utility of including additional variables against the risk of selecting superfluous variables.

a defective Huntingtin gene, with symptoms that progressively worsen and eventually
lead to a clinical diagnosis. Identifying the clinical and demographic factors

We propose a joint model to relate symptom severity $y$ and time-to-diagnosis
$x$, conditional on clinical and demographic predictor variables $\\mathbf{z}$.
However, it may be that certain predictor variables are important for $y$ but
not for $x$ and vice-versa, so we use regularisation techniques to select different
sets of predictor variables for $y$ and $x$. Since $x$ is a time-to-event variable,
there is the added challenge that many of its values are right-censored due
to individuals who did not develop the disease during the study. Therefore,
to fit the joint model, we apply the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm
to alternate between parameter estimation and imputation of the right-censored
values until convergence. We demonstrate our method on Huntington's disease
patient data, showcasing how users can choose appropriate values for the regularisation

Methods that identify statistical associations lack interpretability or reproducibility. We can address these limitations by inferring stable associations that are robust to external perturbation on the data. Stable associations can be an implication in causality since causal relationships are necessarily stable in some sense (Pearl et al. 2009). Unstable associations can also be of interests in certain biological applications to study functional heterogeneity in a biological system.

We developed a new regression framework, StableMate based on the concept of stabilised regression (SR), which utilise heterogenous data to enforce stability (Pfister et al. 2021). Given datasets generated from different environments, such as experiments or disease states, StableMate 1. identifies stable predictors with consistent functional dependency with the response across environments. 2. builds a robust regression model with stable predictors to enforce generalisable prediction in unseen environments. The ultimate aim is to build selection ensembles. However, unlike SR that selects stable predictors by performing stability tests on every possible predictor subset, StableMate optimizes efficiency with a greedy search based on our improved stochastic stepwise selection algorithm. In a simulation study, we show that StableMate outperformed SR for both variable selection and prediction and significantly reduces running time. In three case studies of cancer with different omics data types, we show that StableMate can also address a wide range of biological questions.

A key challenge in limiting the costs of an eradication campaign is knowing the size of the remaining population of invasive animals; this information informs both ongoing resource planning and when to end a campaign. Campaign progress is measured by the decline in detections of the target species. However, detection of a population is imperfect and highly variable, obscuring the true rate of decline. As a result, uncertainty arises when detections cease - have all individuals truly been eradicated, or do some remain undetected? Statistical models have been developed to infer eradication success based on a record of detections (sighting records), however, most models ignore natural heterogeneity in detectability. 
Our work examines the influence of variance in detection rates on the false positive and false negative error rates of hypothetical eradication campaigns and relates this to overall costs of island conservation.

The zero-inflated Tweedie model uses a mixture model approach that integrates a Tweedie model with a binary model to distinguish between excess zeros - those resulting from an independent process, and true zeros those resulting from the Tweedie model itself.

Standard SCR methods assume animal movements are independent and consequently cannot incorporate site fidelity (attachment to a particular region) nor the temporal correlation of an animal’s location. Recent work has sought to solve these issues by explicitly modelling animal movement.

In this talk we propose an alternative solution for camera trapping surveys based on a multivariate self-exciting Hawkes process. Here the rates of detection of a given animal at a given camera are a function of not only the location and its proximity to the animal’s activity center, but also where and when the animal was most recently detected.

Through a mixture of Gaussian distributions, our model expects more detections closer in space to the last detection, and reduces to SCR when an animal is yet to be detected. This formulation, we believe, better reflects animal behaviour because shortly after detection, we expect to see an individual close to where it was last seen. Thus, our model allows us to account for both site fidelity and the inherent temporal correlation in detections that have not previously been accounted for in SCR-type models.

One such method is the cluster detection test (CDT), which identifies non-random spatial distributions of diseases and highlights high-prevalence regions without prior assumptions. Among CDT methods, scan statistics are compelling and use a maximum likelihood framework to search across spatial and/or temporal windows for potential clusters. Examples include Kulldorff’s circular scan statistic and the flexibly shaped scan statistic by Tango and Takahashi. More recently, Takahashi and Shimadzu proposed a scan-based method that simultaneously detects multiple clusters by integrating generalized linear models and an information criterion to determine the optimal number of clusters. Traditional scan-based tests often assume that disease risk is uniformly elevated within a single cluster. However, they may mistakenly combine multiple adjacent hotspots—each with potentially different risk levels—into one, thereby masking meaningful spatial heterogeneity. In this study, we propose a new test procedure that more accurately identifies adjacent hotspot clusters as distinct entities. Our approach enhances the scan statistic framework by incorporating Cochran’s Q-statistic to assess heterogeneity within clusters.

A shift parameter is introduced at each timepoint, with the goal being that outliers receive a non-zero shift parameter while clean timepoints receive a zero shift parameter after estimation. The vector of shift parameters is penalised to ensure that not all shift parameters are trivially non-zero. Apart from making it feasible to fit accurate and reliable time series models in the presence of additive outliers, other benefits of this approach include automatic outlier flagging and visual diagnostics to provide researchers and practitioners with better insights into the outlier structure of their data.

In contrast, conservation listing advice and associated recovery plans require population estimates at the species-range scale. A data-driven, national-scale population estimate including all available information will therefore guide effective management of koala populations by providing high-quality and objective information. To this end, we have designed nationally consistent survey, implemented it (with the aid of partners) and analysed the resulting data (and others). The design uses recently developed techniques (clustered spatially-balanced designs) whilst the analysis uses emerging models that incorporate multiple data types (e.g. point process, binary and count) that are often-enough collected using different equipment, protocols and staff. Integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have, at their heart, a simple point process but this simplicity still allows for some complexity in terms of how different types of data can inform the point process.

Statistical modelling using GLMMs introduces additional complexities arising from a combination of (i) susceptibility to large estimation biases due to approximations of the marginal likelihood, (ii) accounting for heterogeneity of variance/dispersion, and (iii) the increase in computational resources required.

The analysis approach uses a GLMM framework, assuming an underlying mean-parameterised Conway-Maxwell Poisson distribution, that can account for arbitrarily under and over-dispersed count data. This framework enables partitioning of residual variation from genetic and other extraneous sources of variation, and adopts a factor-analytic model for the genotype by environment interaction effects. The proposed methodology is applied to a series of common bean trials, where the aim is genotype selection for the response variable pod count per plant.

While many machine learning techniques prioritise accuracy, they overlook two crucial issues: the imbalance of fraud versus legitimate transaction data, and the transparency of the model decision-making process. 

We position RSFs as a potential solution, leveraging their time-to-event structure to enable dynamic fraud prediction and their ensemble nature to handle high-dimensional, skewed datasets. Using real-world transactional data, the presentation addresses model imbalance through resampling strategies and evaluates the model’s ability to detect minority-class fraud events without inflating false positives. 

Furthermore, the interpretability of RSFs is explored through explainable AI frameworks, offering transparency essential for regulatory compliance and institutional trust. By investigating RSFs to deliver fraud detection that is both accurate and accountable, this presentation bridges algorithmic robustness with transparency, advancing a practical and governance-aligned solution for responsible AI deployment in today’s increasingly regulated financial services landscape.`], "talk_2": [`Using point cloud data to discover genomic regions associated with dynamic height`], "talk_2_speakers": [`Colleen H Hunt 👤`, `David R.

Moench*), influences yield, lodging resistance, and harvestability, yet conventional methods usually measure plant height at maturity, but this single-time-point measurement misses the growth dynamics across the season. Tracking and analysing height over time can reveal more about the genetic factors controlling development rate and pattern. 
Data from 881 sorghum lines from a diverse population were planted in a partially replicated design with 1190 plots. UAV-based high-throughput phenotyping was used to generate weekly plant height measurements from emergence to flowering. These aerial images were collected and processed using photogrammetric software to create dense point clouds and canopy height models for each plot. 
A logistic regression model within a linear mixed model framework was applied to effectively depict the sigmoidal growth pattern typical of sorghum, with parameters indicating maximum height, growth rate, and inflection point. These biologically relevant parameters offered a straightforward, quantitative summary of each genotype’s growth trajectory. The logistic growth parameters were then used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci linked to the dynamic aspects of height development, with several significant associations detected. 
This is among the first studies to combine logistic growth modelling of high-throughput UAV data with GWAS to dissect the genetic control of growth dynamics in sorghum. Our findings underline the usefulness of logistic regression for modelling crop growth and showcase the effectiveness of combining UAV phenotyping, statistical growth modelling, and GWAS to identify genomic regions that influence developmental trajectories in sorghum.

Causal machine learning (CML) methods are increasingly popular for ATE estimation, as they leverage data-adaptive algorithms to account for complex relationships amongst confounders, exposure and outcome while ensuring valid inference. Major CML methods, such as double machine learning and targeted maximum likelihood estimation, offer robustness and efficiency advantages but they require first estimating the propensity score and then calculating treatment divided by the propensity score, known as the Riesz representer. Standard machine learning algorithms for the propensity score estimation are suboptimal as they are designed to minimise prediction error, ignoring that equally large estimation errors in small and large propensity scores propagate very differently into the ATE estimates upon taking the reciprocal. Automatic debiased machine learning (autoDML), introduced by Chernozhukov et al. (2021), addresses this issue by directly estimating the Riesz representer using machine learning methods, yielding a more stable alternative to standard CML methods. Despite its theoretical advances, autoDML remains largely unknown in biostatistical research and has not been compared to standard CML methods in realistic simulation studies. 
In this talk, we bridge these gaps by introducing autoDML and highlighting its advantages. We describe a practical, step-by-step guide for implementing autoDML, and compare autoDML with standard CML methods using comprehensive, realistic simulation studies.

This ongoing study compares atmospheric modelling with detection patterns from long-term field surveillance to evaluate how different models can be integrated to increase confidence in identifying likely source regions, arrival pathways and periods of elevated risk. We apply three complementary models: HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory), FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model), and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). These models range in complexity - from simulating basic wind trajectories to identifying hidden transport patterns within the atmosphere.
A rich empirical foundation is provided by two decades of fruit fly trapping data collected through the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) in the Torres Strait. By identifying likely incursion windows for Oriental Fruit Fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) arrivals from Papua New Guinea, we evaluate and compare model performance and gain insights into potential dispersal mechanisms. While model implementation and case analysis are still underway, preliminary results suggest that combining outputs from different models improves the detection and interpretation of likely incursion events.
Future work will focus on integrating these model outputs with additional environmental and biological datasets to produce dynamic risk maps. These maps aim to support NAQS surveillance planning and resource prioritisation.

Statistically significant random intercepts and random slopes for linear time trends are identified at the state-age-sex level. The spatio-temporal extension of the multinomial multilevel logistic model yields detailed estimates, helping to uncover disparities in the trends of smoking decline. Temporal random effects at the state-sex and age-sex levels also substantially contribute to achieving numerically consistent trend estimates.

Its transitivity constraint—each pairwise preference must be consistent with a global ranking—yields excellent performance in many applications, including sports analytics, psychometric scaling, and clinical preference studies. However, empirical datasets sometimes exhibit cyclic dominance, rendering the classical model inadequate and leading to systematic misfit.

Real-world data often display cyclic patterns, resembling a “rock-paper-scissors” dynamic, which can violate the transitivity constraint typically expected in such analyses. To address this issue, we first review important applications of the Bradley-Terry model and highlight instances where non-transitive outcomes occur. Next, we introduce a minimal extension of the model that preserves the original likelihood but adds a single \"cycle-strength\" parameter. This parameter is designed to capture uniform three-way dominance among any trio of outcomes. When the cycle-strength parameter is set to zero, the model reverts to the classical Bradley-Terry framework. Importantly, we demonstrate that our cycle strength corresponds precisely to the quasi-asymmetry measure proposed by Tahata et al.

It essentially deals with the sampling of materials, particularly soils, composts,and minerals. It enjoys a strong advocacy amongst chemical engineers, geologists and similar professionals. The ToS instructs practitioners to stop and think about the sampling procedure. It encourages them to consider all the sources of variation in the material they wish to sample rather than just choosing to take the most convenient sample such as a “grab sample” from the surface. However, one of its strongest advocates argues that, in order to save on analysis costs, only one “correct” composite sample is necessary. This single sample, deemed to be “representative” of the entire material, is all that is required to characterise a material (Esbenson (2017)). Composting sampling guidelines around the world use the ToS to justify this practice of single sampling. For example, it has currently been recommended in the AS4454 review in Australia (https://www.as4454review.com.au/). However, with only one sample analysed, contributions to measurement uncertainty from either the sampling or analysis processes, cannot be assessed. It is concerning that despite the apparent sophistication of ToS methodology and the breadth of its advocacy network, it perpetuates the scientifically unsound idea of a “representative sample.” .Even the name, “Theory of Sampling”, is a misnomer, suggesting an even broader application than just the sampling of materials. We review the ToS and consider implications to statistical practise and adoption.

However, the gold standard tests used to confirm diagnoses are frequently invasive, expensive, or impractical for population-level screening. This highlights the importance of developing and validating simple, non-invasive screening tests.
Diagnostic performance is typically evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). However, when disease prevalence is low or class imbalance exists, accuracy and Sp may not adequately reflect test performance. $F_1$ score, which considers both Se and PPV, has been widely adopted in such settings as a balanced measure of diagnostic ability.
A limitation of the $F_1$ score is its reliance on the true disease status defined by a gold standard. In some fields, however, the disease mechanism may be unclear or the definition of clinical signs ambiguous, making it difficult to define a reliable gold standard. This presents challenges for evaluating diagnostic accuracy using conventional methods.
To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian framework that enables estimation of the $F_1$ score without directly observing gold standard outcomes. The approach uses latent class analysis to estimate unobserved disease status and offers a promising method for assessing test performance in settings where the gold standard is unavailable or uncertain

This study proposes a novel Bayesian approach that combines Gaussian copula graphical models with advanced shrinkage priors, including horseshoe priors and double exponential priors.

This combination addresses both the mixed-data challenge and the high-dimensionality issue simultaneously. We develop an efficient posterior sampling algorithm that maintains the positive definiteness of correlation matrices by employing a block Gibbs sampler with hit-and-run algorithm. Our approach utilizes rank information to handle mixed-type data within the copula framework, enabling unified treatment of continuous and discrete variables.

We propose a novel correspondence analysis (CA) framework to evaluate departures from symmetry in square contingency tables with nominal scales, using a power-divergence-type measure. This approach ensures that well-known divergences can also be visualized and, regardless of the divergence used, the CA plot consists of two principal axes with equal contribution rates. Our visualization method enables the magnitude of each category’s departure from symmetry to be assessed by its deviation from the origin, while asymmetric relationships between category pairs can be interpreted through corresponding triangle areas.

Our method integrates sparse estimation techniques—such as lasso, ridge, and their convex combinations—into this broader modeling framework, enhancing model interpretability and stability in high-dimensional settings. The algorithm is implemented in the vglmnet function within the new VGAMplus package for R. It leverages a modified iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) procedure, combined with pathwise coordinate descent, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition checks, and strong rules for variable screening to ensure computational efficiency.

A technique that has proven useful for the modelling of non-smooth trends is the wavelet transform. Existing methods to incorporate the wavelet transform into the LMM framework are varied, but often share a common limitation; that is, a reliance on classical wavelet approaches that require observations to be equidistant and dyadic ($\\log_{2}(n)$ is an integer) in number. More recently, second generation wavelet methods have been developed, which overcome the limiting constraints imposed by classical wavelet approaches, enabling the wavelet transform to be applied to sets of non-equidistant observations, of any number. We present a method for the incorporation of these second generation wavelets, namely second generation B-spline wavelets, into an LMM framework to facilitate the wavelet transform.

This study presents a Bayesian framework for analysing ordinal data from field trials, including growth scale progression and disease ranking scores. Using the brms package in R, we applied cumulative logit models to evaluate the effects of sowing depth and treatment combinations on cereal growth stages, measured via the Zadok’s scale, across two Western Australian sites (Merredin and Wickepin). The same framework is being extended to model disease severity scores, demonstrating its versatility across categorical biological measurements.
Our workflow incorporates rigorous model testing and evaluation, including posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV), to ensure robust inference and model fit. Rather than relying on p-values from linear mixed models, the Bayesian approach provides interpretable probabilities of achieving specific growth stages or disease severity levels.

One factor that cannot be anticipated in advance is the size of the incursion at the time of its detection. Unfortunately, the impact of an incursion is tightly tied to its maturity at detection, ranging from a single seed, for example, to a 50,000 hectare infestation of plants. 

We propose a simple probability model for the detection of an invasive species that can either capture or integrate out the consequent uncertainty of the maturity of the incursion. We represent the relationship between surveillance and the detection of the organism using survival analysis: the detection of the incursion is analogous to the survival event; it is a binary occurrence that happens at some point in time, and once it has happened it does not happen again.

Under such a model, we can connect the distribution of the size of the infestation at the time to detection to the probability of detecting the incursion given that it has not already been detected, namely, the hazard function. For example, a popular model for the detection of an incursion of size x with number of traps t and probability of detecting a single pest $p$ is:

$h(x,t,p) = 1 - (1 - p)^{tx}$ 

Algebra leads us to a size-at-detection pdf.  Other corrections are also applied as needed. The outcome is a pdf that is a function of process parameters, enabling straightforward assessment of different surveillance choices. Parameter estimates for the distribution can be derived from first principles, field experiments, or expert elicitation.

In this presentation we will derive and demonstrate the use of the survival-based incursion size at detection pdf and discuss its implications and challenges.`], "talk_2": [`Optimal allocation of resources between control and surveillance for complex eradication scenarios`], "talk_2_speakers": [`Mahdi Parsa 👤`, `Belinda Parsa 👤`], "talk_2_orgs": [`Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry`, `Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry`], "talk_2_abstract": [`Effective eradication of invasive species over large areas requires strategic

A common screening strategy involves pooling items from consignments and testing each group for contamination presence, with consignments typically rejected if any group tests positive. Although screening designs often target a high probability of detection assuming a fixed minimum prevalence, analysing the historical results of these tests to infer the extent of contamination in non-rejected consignments (referred to as leakage) is less common.

This study advances censored beta-binomial (BB) models to address contamination risk in frozen seafood imports into Australia, incorporating imperfect tests. Motivated by the characteristics of our case study, we develop a new class of BB models that impose a minimum positive consignment propensity threshold, capturing scenarios where contamination is either absent or exceeds a known minimum level. To fit these models, we propose a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm conditioned on prior distributions for sensitivity and specificity, allowing efficient estimation of quantities related to contamination levels. We analyse historical testing data under multiple scenarios using the proposed MH algorithm, yielding novel insights into both contamination risk and leakage.

Finally, we use model-based simulations to communicate risk levels, providing key insights into potential undetected contamination.`], "par_id": [`1`], "par_total": [`2`], "talk_4": [`Optimal sampling in border biosecurity: Application to skip-lot sampling`], "talk_4_speakers": [`Raphael Trouve 👤`], "talk_4_orgs": [`The University of Melbourne`], "talk_4_abstract": [`Border biosecurity faces mounting pressure from increasing global trade, requiring cost-effective inspection strategies to reduce the risk of importing pest and diseases.

When should agencies use skip-lot sampling (SLS, sometimes called continuous sampling plan), which adaptively reduces inspections based on recent compliance history, over full census inspection?

We developed a propagule pressure equation for SLS in overdispersed pathways and used Lagrange multipliers to derive a solution.

There are two main sources of error to contend with - sampling error (because the last time you see a species need not be the last time it was there) and measurement error (dating specimens, usually well known). The paleobiology literature typically ignores one or other of these sources of error, leading to bias and underestimation of uncertainty to an extent that is often qualitatively important. 

The problem is surprisingly difficult to address statistically, because while standard regularity conditions are technically satisfied, we are typically close to a boundary where they break down, and hence standard asymptotic approaches to inference typically perform poorly in practice. We propose using a novel method, which we call regression inversion, for exact inference, and we apply this technique to a compound uniform-truncated t (CUTT) model for fossil data. We show via simulation that this approach leads to unbiased estimators, and accurate interval inference, in contrast to its competitors.

We explore using a multivariate extension of Tucker’s congruence coefficient for this purpose. Tucker’s congruence coefficient can be thought of as the length of the projection of one factor direction onto another, or equivalently the (absolute) cosine of the angle between them; thus it ranges from 0 to 1. In (eg) two dimensions, we consider the square root of the area of a unit square projected from one space onto another; this can be generalized for any number of dimensions. The measure is symmetric and invariant to rotation. To contextualize scores on this measure, we compute this measure of agreement for several datasets from the dietary pattern validation literature, where the same food questionnaire is given to the same people a few weeks apart. We also consider the effect of truncating small loadings, as is common when describing dietary patterns.

Biodiversity is a quantity of fundamental interest, but measuring it remains challenging. Two key aspects of diversity are functional diversity (FD)—the extent to which species in a community differ in their ecological functions—and phylogenetic diversity (PD)—the extent to which species differ in their evolutionary histories.

**Limitations** 
Commonly used distance-based diversity measures, such as Rao’s Q and Faith's PD, are typically affected by sampling intensity, which refers to the level of effort invested in collecting samples. Specifically, these measures confound true diversity changes with changes in species richness driven by different sampling intensities. In addition, there is no established statistical framework for analyzing how diversity changes along environmental gradients.

**Our Model**
We propose a model-based assessment of PD and FD changes along gradients. It is robust to variations in sampling intensity, as the model explicitly captures the main trend in abundance change—namely, changes in species richness—and then isolates the residual variation, the $\\beta$-diversity change. We then measure PD or FD change using linear contrasts of the $\\beta$-diversity parameters, where the contrasts correspond to the main axes of the phylogenetic or functional similarity matrix.

Based on the presence/absence pattern, we conducted simulations in which we designed phylogenetic distance matrices with different numbers of species, modelled on real data.

system of allometric differential equations that models internal energy allocation between
two fundamental biological processes, growth and reproduction, under different
thermal regimes.

Climate change is not only driving increases in mean temperatures but also intensifying
temperature variability, resulting in greater environmental unpredictability. While
temperature is known to regulate resource allocation in ectotherms, the consequences
of stochastic thermal fluctuations for life-history traits remain poorly understood. Using
*Daphnia magna* as a model organism, we present a novel allometric growth model
that characterises energy allocation dynamics in fluctuating thermal environments. Our
framework quantifies the effects of randomly varying temperatures on lifetime patterns
of growth and reproduction. Our model reveals that exposure to unpredictable thermal
regimes can elicit life-history responses similar to those observed under persistently
elevated temperatures. Importantly, our energy-based approach identifies patterns of
reproductive investment that are not discernible from growth data alone, highlighting
the pivotal role of temperature variability in shaping life-history trajectories. As climate
change increasingly entails unpredictable environmental conditions, the model
and findings presented here offer valuable tools for anticipating and managing biological
responses to future climate scenarios.`], "par_id": [`2`], "par_total": [`2`], "talk_4": [`A circular hidden Markov model for directional time series data`], "talk_4_speakers": [`A.A.P.N.M.

Standard linear time series techniques do not account for the circularity of the observations, while existing circular modeling approaches typically work best when the data span a small arc.

Motivated by a series of fire burn experiments collecting wind direction in southeastern Australia, we propose a new method for directional time series data that combines the flexibility of hidden Markov models for capturing different latent states at different periods of time, with a conditional von Mises distribution given the latent state to explicitly account for the circular nature of the responses. The resulting circular hidden Markov model (cHMM) can allow for multimodality and/or varying amounts of circular dispersion over time.

Furthermore, by utilizing a von Mises distribution whose mean direction depends on previous observations, we can accommodate serial correlations within a specific hidden state. We employ direct maximum likelihood estimation to fit the cHMM, and examine three approaches to perform forecasting based on extrapolating the latent state sequence and then direction observations conditional on this sequence. An application to the motivating wind direction datasets reveals that cHMMs produce similar or better point/probabilistic forecasting performance compared with several established time series methods.

Pig body weight values estimated by a conventional approach or a computer vision system can be considered as two different measurements of the same trait, but with different sources of phenotyping error. Previous studies have shown that trait measurement error, defined as the difference between manually collected phenotypes and image-derived phenotypes, can be influenced by genetics, suggesting that the error is systematic rather than random and is more likely to lead to misleading quantitative genetic analysis results. Therefore, we investigated the effect of trait measurement error on genetic analysis of pig body weight (BW). Calibrated scale-based and image-based BW showed high coefficients of determination and goodness of fit. Genomic heritability estimates for scale-based and image-based BW were mostly identical across growth periods. Genomic heritability estimates for trait measurement error were consistently negligible, regardless of the choice of computer vision algorithm. In addition, genome-wide association analysis revealed no overlap between the top markers identified for scale-based BW and those associated with trait measurement error. Overall, the deep learning-based regressions outperformed the adaptive thresholding segmentation methods. This study showed that manually measured scale-based and image-based BW phenotypes yielded the same quantitative genetic results. We found no evidence that BW trait measurement error could be influenced, at least in part, by genetic factors.

Our investigation focused on whether there has been an increase in the presence and abundance of noisy miners, an endemic species known for its aggressive and territorial behaviour, and whether this could partly explain apparent declines in other species.

The dataset was augmented with weather, geospatial and ecological information, and a mixed-effects modelling framework was adopted. Seasonal effects and long-term trends were accounted for via regression splines. The influence of different observers and locations were represented as random effects. GAMMs were fitted for (a) the presence/absence of noisy miners, (b) the abundance of noisy miners, and (c) species richness for particular groupings of birds. In modelling species richness, noisy miner abundance was included as a predictor; we used multiple imputation to account for the missing data when this species was reported as “present” but no count was recorded.

There was a small, positive association found between noisy miner abundance and all-species diversity – a surprising result. A stronger negative association was found for some species groupings. For many species groups, diversity tended to decrease with increasing distance from the nearest native vegetation feature, and with increasing wind speed.

Thrall`, `Andrew G. Young`], "talk_3_orgs": [`CSIRO`], "talk_3_abstract": [`Climate change is driving widespread shifts in plant phenology globally, with critical implications for ecosystem functioning and species interactions. While most phenological studies focus on temperate deciduous species at local scales, Australia's diverse Acacia genus offers unique opportunities to understand phenological responses to variations in rainfall and temperature across continental gradients. Leveraging digitised herbarium collections, we present the largest phylogenetically-informed analysis of acacia flowering phenology undertaken to date, spanning 548 species across Australia's full climatic spectrum.

We developed a novel phenological modelling approach using a Bayesian hierarchical framework that makes several key innovations. First, we extend traditional phylogenetic least squares (PGLS) approaches by incorporating phylogenetic signal as a structured random effect within a fully Bayesian context, enabling simultaneous estimation of phylogenetic covariance alongside spatial and temporal dependencies. Second, we employ von Mises circular distributions to model flowering time, naturally accommodating seasonal cyclicity while avoiding linear boundary artifacts. This modular approach also integrates spatial autocorrelation structure, time-lagged climate covariates, and phylogenetic relationships within a unified probabilistic framework. Our analysis of 20,998 herbarium specimens spans 110 years (1910 – 2020) across Australia, using climate observations from the Australian Gridded Climate Data, with Köppen climate zones included in the model to stratify climate-phenology relationships.

This framework successfully quantifies species-specific climate sensitivities while accounting for phylogenetic constraints. Expected effect of time-lagged temperature and rainfall effects vary significantly across Köppen climate zones and species. Species vulnerability patterns could help identify taxa which could be potentially at higher risk under projected climate scenarios. This modular Bayesian approach demonstrates the research potential of natural history collections for continental-scale ecological inference, providing a statistical template for global phenological studies addressing critical climate change impacts.

Recent advances in data acquisition technology have made it easier to obtain a wide range of environmental predictors at appropriate spatio-temporal scales and at consistent resolutions needed for effective research.

By using dynamic predictors and anomalies from their mean values in spatio-temporal species distribution models we see if we can detect species response to climate change and if this yields better predictive performance than current practice.

But meta-analysis typically uses a mixed model, with the variance structure of study-level random effects known, so it should be possible to fit such models using standard mixed modelling software. We propose using the \`glmmTMB\` package for this purpose. In the last decade, \`glmmTMB\` has developed into a flexible package to fit generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) via the Template Model Builder (TMB) framework. The package holds a similar interface as the \`lme4\` package but supports a broader range of distributions and covariance structures using Laplace approximation. Here, we introduce a new covariance structure, called “*equalto*”, to the \`glmmTMB\` package, so that it can be used to fit meta-analytic models by allowing users to specify a known variance-covariance matrix for the sampling error. This enables explicit modelling of heteroscedasticity or dependence among effect sizes. The new implementation offers an alternative way to do a meta-analysis, convenient for users already familiar with fitting mixed models in \`lme4\` or \`glmmTMB\` packages, and capable of handling complex model structures.

However, constructing accurate confidence intervals for these components remains challenging with small samples or near-boundary estimates, where asymptotic methods (e.g., profile likelihood, Wald intervals) do not perform well. To address this, we propose a novel simulation-based framework using bootstrap test inversion coupled with quantile regression. Our approach efficiently estimates confidence limits by leveraging the continuous distribution of the estimator, eliminating discretization steps inherent in conventional bootstrap procedures. This enhances robustness in low-information scenarios while adapting to boundary constraints. 
Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves superior coverage accuracy compared to existing asymptotic and bootstrap alternatives under small-sample conditions and near-boundary parameters. We show the application of the technique to an ecological case study analysing response of species composition to environmental gradients.

The proposed method is a generalization of the random effect block bootstrap, originally designed for the balanced case, and can be used to perform inferences on parameters of the linear mixed model or functions thereof. We establish asymptotic consistency of the proposed bootstrap under general cluster sizes scenario, showing that the original random effect block bootstrap is only consistent when cluster sizes are balanced. A modified random effect block bootstrap is also proposed which enjoys similar asymptotic consistency properties as the proportional random effect block bootstrap. Simulation study demonstrates the strong finite sample inferential performance of the proposed bootstraps, particularly compared with the random effect block bootstrap and several existing bootstrap methods for clustered data. We apply the proposed bootstraps to the Oman rainfall enhancement trial dataset with cluster sizes ranging from 1 to 58.

The Global Vaccine Data Network (GVDN) is a multinational collaboration established to conduct globally coordinated epidemiological studies on vaccine safety using health data. This study aimed to assess the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 42 days after exposure to any COVID-19 vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection, combing multisite data using a common GVDN protocol and data model. 

Methods:
We used a self-controlled case series (SCCS) design and identified GBS cases via electronic data sources (EDS) from 20 GVDN sites globally. Fifteen sites performed medical chart review using Brighton Collaboration case definitions to determine the level of diagnostic certainty (LOC). The relative incidence (RI) between pre-defined risk and control windows was calculated using conditional Poisson regression, controlling for seasonality. De-identified case-level data were combined for individual patient data (IPD) analysis, and the estimates were aggregated with otherwise locally analysed site-level results to calculate the overall RI with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using random effects meta-analysis. 

Results:
We identified 2086 GBS cases (4329 vaccine doses) from EDS and 410 cases were chart-reviewed (12% with LOC 1-2). We observed an association between Vaxzevria/Covishield vaccine and GBS among LOC 1-2 cases within 42 days post-exposure (RI 3.10, 95%CI 1.12-8.62). No increased risk of GBS was observed with mRNA and other vaccines. Among 489 EDS -identified cases post-infection, significant risk was found between SARS-CoV-2 and GBS (RI 3.35, 95%CI 1.83-6.11).

Following implementation of new birthing protocols aimed at reducing birth-related injuries, in a Sydney health district, a follow-up study was designed to evaluate incontinence outcomes. However, the missing data pattern proved to be informatively related to both treatment and outcome variables: women who experienced successful outcomes (no incontinence) were systematically less likely to attend follow-up appointments. The situation was further complicated when the COVID-19 pandemic struck mid-study, dramatically reducing attendance rates and introducing an additional layer of correlated missingness that varied by treatment timing and baseline characteristics. Working within the constraints of the study design and the budget for a statistician, I developed a model for missingness which I will outline in this talk.

While missing data complications can severely challenge study validity, thoughtful statistical approaches can still yield meaningful insights when the caveats (caveats galore!) are properly acknowledged and addressed.

The partial conjunction (PC) p-value proposed by Benjamini and Heller (Biometrics, 2008), which summarizes individual base p-values obtained from multiple similar studies, can gauge whether a signal of interest is replicable. However, when a large set of features are examined by these studies (such as comparable genomewide association studies conducted by different labs), testing for their replicated signals simultaneously can pose a very underpowered problem, due to both the multiplicity correction required and the inherent limitations of PC p-values. This power deficiency is particularly severe when replication is demanded for all studies, the most natural benchmark a practitioner performing meta-analyses may request. 

We propose ParFilter, a procedure that combines the ideas of filtering and covariate-adaptiveness to power up large-scale testing for replicated signals as described above. It validly reduces the multiplicity burden by partitioning the studies into smaller groups and borrowing between-group information to filter out unpromising features. Moreover, harnessing side information offered by available covariates, it trains hypothesis weights to encourage rejections of features more likely to exhibit replicated signals. We prove its finite-sample false discovery rate control under standard assumptions on the dependence of the base p-values across features. In simulations as well as a real case study on autoimmunity based on RNA-Seq data obtained from thymic cells, the ParFilter has demonstrated competitive performance against other existing methods for such replicability analyses.

In line with this idea, we develop RESET (REScoring via Estimating and Training), which uses a unique data-splitting protocol that subsequently allows any semi-supervised learning approach to factor in the available side information while maintaining finite sample error rate control. Our practical implementation, RESET Ensemble, selects from an ensemble of classification algorithms so that it is compatible with a range of multiple testing scenarios without the need for the user to select the appropriate one. We apply RESET to both p-value and competition based multiple testing problems and show that RESET is (1) power-wise competitive, (2) fast compared to most tools and (3) able to uniquely achieve finite sample false discovery rate or false discovery exceedance control, depending on the user's preference.`], "par_id": [`1`], "par_total": [`2`], },

Reproducible research ensures that scientific findings can be independently verified by others using the same data and methods. Markdown plays a key role in supporting reproducibility by allowing researchers to combine code, results, and narrative text in a clear, lightweight format. Tools like R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks use Markdown to embed executable code alongside explanations and outputs, making it easy to document workflows, share analyses, and regenerate results consistently across different environments.

Genstat is a statistical software package designed for data analysis, particularly in biometrical research and applications. Many users know it through its user-friendly interface. However, it also It offers a powerful scripting language.

In this talk I will describe a collaborative project between students and staff at the University of Auckland and VSNi Ltd, that allows Genstat to be used in conjunction with R Markdown to provide flexible reproducible research capability to the Genstat user community.`], "talk_2": [`The 4S method for the longitudinal analysis of multidimensional questionnaires: application to Parkinson’s disease progression from patient perception`], "talk_2_speakers": [`Tiphaine Saulnier 👤`, `Cecile Proust-Lima`, `Daniel J.

Longitudinal analysis of these tools offers valuable insights into disease progression. However, this raises multiple challenges, such as handling repeated ordinal responses, capturing the multidimensional traits underlying all the items, and accounting for informative dropout due to death during follow-up.
In this work, we present the 4S method – a comprehensive strategy developed to address these challenges, and illustrate it describing health-related QoL (Hr-QoL) changes in Parkinson’s disease (PD).

**Methods** The 4S method comprises four successive steps:
(*1 – structuring*) identify questionnaire dimensions through factor analyses;
(*2 – sequencing*) describe each dimension progression and associated predictors with a joint latent process model combining an item-response mixed model and a proportional hazard for death risk;
(*3 – staging*) compare progression across dimension continuums by projecting clinical stages;
(*4 – selecting*) highlight stage-specific most informative items based on Fisher information.

**Application** We analyzed longitudinal data from the New Zealand Parkinson Progression Programme (NZP$^3$), following over 400 PD patients for up to 16 years. Hr-QoL was measured via the PDQ-39 questionnaire, covering motor and non-motor spheres. Five dimensions were identified: mobility, daily activities, psycho-social, stigma, and cognition/communication/bodily discomfort. All, except stigma, showed progressive decline, with patterns notably varying by sex and onset age. Items related to walking, dexterity, anxiety, and communication appeared as particularly sensitive during PD stages, offering guidance to enhance patient-centered care.

**Conclusion** The 4S method is a comprehensive statistical strategy suited to analyze repeatedly-collected questionnaires in health studies.`], "talk_3": [`\`heritable\` An R package for heritability calculations for plant breeding trials`], "talk_3_speakers": [`Fonti Kar 👤`, `Emi Tanaka`], "talk_3_orgs": [`Australian National University`], "talk_3_abstract": [`Understanding how much biological variation is heritable - or passed down from one generation to next - is central to plant breeding.

It is not unusual that we become accustomed to vertical thinking whereby we use existing tools and methods in our own specialty to problem solve, losing sight of the larger interdisciplinary context of data science, and the context of the scientific challenge. The Government of Canada - Science and Technology branch has identified several priority research challenge topics that involve cross-disciplinary work. Although statistical tools and analytics are identified in these research challenge priority areas, additionally, the development of fundamental transformative and enabling technological tools specifically for statistical methods and analytics to support research and societal advancement is also seen as a priority. This talk shares insights about the challenges and opportunities for statistics in interdisciplinary research. Specifically, monitoring viral signals in wastewater and assessing forest fire risk are given as complex, case studies that use a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to solve difficult problems. This approach will demonstrate the significant benefits for not only optimizing research impact but for training students to become horizontal problem solvers across a wide range of research methods which will benefit them in navigating complex problems and in the development of appropriate tools for their analysis.`], "biography": [`**Dr. Charmaine Dean** (Ph.D., University of Waterloo) is Vice-President, Research and International at the University of Waterloo.
