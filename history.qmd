[Australasian region of the International Biometric Society](https://biometricsociety.org.au/) has existed since 1948 with its flagship regional conference held biannually. The regional conference is the prime destination for Australasian statistics and data science in the biosciences. Society has a rich history rooted in statistical theory, methodology and practice. More recent advancements attract diverse skills that span into data science.

With only a maximum of two parallel sessions, the conference offers an intimate gathering of biometricians, statisticians, data scientists and alike in the Australasian region. The conference gives a prime opportunity to network with the regional biometrics community.
