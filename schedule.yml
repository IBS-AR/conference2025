    abstract: "One of the key choices we have as scientists is to design informative experiments. With computational methods like AI promising accurate predictions, we revisit the question of adaptively designing new measurements that take previous data into account. Using examples from genomics, we illustrate some recent ideas on using machine learning to recommend experiments. Then we discuss potential impacts on choosing measurements in spatiotemporal problems. We conclude by outlining some opportunities and challenges of including machine learning in the scientific discovery process."

    talk_1: Data-Adaptive Automatic Threshold Calibration for Stability Selection
    talk_1_speakers:

    talk_1_orgs: The University of Sydney
    talk_1_abstract: Stability selection has gained popularity as a method for enhancing
      the performance of variable selection algorithms while controlling false discovery
      rates. However, achieving these desirable properties depends on correctly specifying
      the stable threshold parameter, which can be challenging. An arbitrary choice
      of this parameter can substantially alter the set of selected variables, as
      the variables' selection probabilities are inherently data-dependent. To address
      this issue, we propose Exclusion Automatic Threshold Selection (EATS), a data-adaptive
      algorithm that streamlines stability selection by automating the threshold specification
      process. EATS initially filters out potential noise variables using an exclusion
      probability threshold, derived from applying stability selection to a randomly
      shuffled version of the dataset. Following this, EATS selects the stable threshold
      parameter using the elbow method, balancing the marginal utility of including
      additional variables against the risk of selecting superfluous variables. We
      evaluate our approach through an extensive simulation study, benchmarking across
      commonly used variable selection algorithms and static stable threshold values.

    talk_2_abstract: |
      Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by
      a defective Huntingtin gene, with symptoms that progressively worsen and eventually
      lead to a clinical diagnosis. Identifying the clinical and demographic factors
      that influence symptom severity and time-to-diagnosis is critical for understanding
      disease progression so that early-intervention strategies can be timely implemented.
      We propose a joint model to relate symptom severity $y$ and time-to-diagnosis
      $x$, conditional on clinical and demographic predictor variables $\mathbf{z}$.
      However, it may be that certain predictor variables are important for $y$ but
      not for $x$ and vice-versa, so we use regularisation techniques to select different
      sets of predictor variables for $y$ and $x$. Since $x$ is a time-to-event variable,
      there is the added challenge that many of its values are right-censored due
      to individuals who did not develop the disease during the study. Therefore,
      to fit the joint model, we apply the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm
      to alternate between parameter estimation and imputation of the right-censored
      values until convergence. We demonstrate our method on Huntington's disease
      patient data, showcasing how users can choose appropriate values for the regularisation
      tuning parameters.

      The University of Melbourne; Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies and
      Statistics, The Australian National University
    talk_3_abstract: "Inferring reproducible relationships between biological variables
      remains a challenge in the statistical analysis of omics data where p > 10,000
      and n < 500. Methods that identify statistical associations lack interpretability
      or reproducibility. We can address these limitations by inferring stable associations
      that are robust to external perturbation on the data. Stable associations can
      be an implication in causality since causal relationships are necessarily stable
      in some sense (Pearl et al. 2009). Unstable associations can also be of interests
      in certain biological applications to study functional heterogeneity in a biological
      system.\r\n\r\nWe developed a new regression framework, StableMate based on
      the concept of stabilised regression (SR), which utilise heterogenous data to
      enforce stability (Pfister et al. 2021). Given datasets generated from different
      environments, such as experiments or disease states, StableMate 1. identifies
      stable predictors with consistent functional dependency with the response across
      environments. 2. builds a robust regression model with stable predictors to
      enforce generalisable prediction in unseen environments. The ultimate aim is
      to build selection ensembles. However, unlike SR that selects stable predictors
      by performing stability tests on every possible predictor subset, StableMate
      optimizes efficiency with a greedy search based on our improved stochastic stepwise
      selection algorithm. In a simulation study, we show that StableMate outperformed
      SR for both variable selection and prediction and significantly reduces running
      time. In three case studies of cancer with different omics data types, we show
      that StableMate can also address a wide range of biological questions.\r\n"

    abstract: |
      The R package {gnm} was designed as a unified interface to fit Generalized Nonlinear Models: _generalized_ to handle responses with restricted range and/or a variance that depends on the mean, and _nonlinear_ to allow the predictor for the mean to be nonlinear in its parameters. This framework covers several models that were proposed in the literature and adopted in practice before {gnm} was released, but used to require a mixed bag of specialised software to fit.

      With {gnm} celebrating its 20th birthday this year, it's a good time to review how the package is being used. I'll highlight some of the applications we were aware of when {gnm} was first developed, that remain in common use, and explore more recent applications, particularly in the field of biometrics.

      We'll discover one motivation for using {gnm}, is for the "eliminate" feature that efficiently estimates stratification parameters. This can be useful even when the predictor is linear, as in the case of using conditional Poisson models to analyse case-crossover studies in epidemiology.  We'll also look at two of the packages that have built on {gnm}. The first, {multgee}, uses {gnm} to fit multiplicative interactions for certain correlation structures when modelling categorical data, with applications in public health, agriculture, and psychology. The second, {VFP}, is a more specialised package that uses {gnm} to model the mean-variance relationship for in-vitro diagnostic assays.

      Through these use cases we'll see how different features of {gnm} can be applied, demonstrating the versatility of this software.
