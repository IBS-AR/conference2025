    abstract: "Interdisciplinary collaborative research is a key component of data science and for some of us, plays an important part of our roles as statisticians. It is not unusual that we become accustomed to vertical thinking whereby we use existing tools and methods in our own specialty to problem solve, losing sight of the larger interdisciplinary context of data science, and the context of the scientific challenge. The Government of Canada - Science and Technology branch has identified several priority research challenge topics that involve cross-disciplinary work. Although statistical tools and analytics are identified in these research challenge priority areas, additionally, the development of fundamental transformative and enabling technological tools specifically for statistical methods and analytics to support research and societal advancement is also seen as a priority. This talk shares insights about the challenges and opportunities for statistics in interdisciplinary research. Specifically, monitoring viral signals in wastewater and assessing forest fire risk are given as complex, case studies that use a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to solve difficult problems. This approach will demonstrate the significant benefits for not only optimizing research impact but for training students to become horizontal problem solvers across a wide range of research methods which will benefit them in navigating complex problems and in the development of appropriate tools for their analysis."

    abstract: "One of the key choices we have as scientists is to design informative experiments. With computational methods like AI promising accurate predictions, we revisit the question of adaptively designing new measurements that take previous data into account. Using examples from genomics, we illustrate some recent ideas on using machine learning to recommend experiments. Then we discuss potential impacts on choosing measurements in spatiotemporal problems. We conclude by outlining some opportunities and challenges of including machine learning in the scientific discovery process."

    abstract: |
      The R package {gnm} was designed as a unified interface to fit Generalized Nonlinear Models: _generalized_ to handle responses with restricted range and/or a variance that depends on the mean, and _nonlinear_ to allow the predictor for the mean to be nonlinear in its parameters. This framework covers several models that were proposed in the literature and adopted in practice before {gnm} was released, but used to require a mixed bag of specialised software to fit.

      With {gnm} celebrating its 20th birthday this year, it's a good time to review how the package is being used. I'll highlight some of the applications we were aware of when {gnm} was first developed, that remain in common use, and explore more recent applications, particularly in the field of biometrics.

      We'll discover one motivation for using {gnm}, is for the "eliminate" feature that efficiently estimates stratification parameters. This can be useful even when the predictor is linear, as in the case of using conditional Poisson models to analyse case-crossover studies in epidemiology.  We'll also look at two of the packages that have built on {gnm}. The first, {multgee}, uses {gnm} to fit multiplicative interactions for certain correlation structures when modelling categorical data, with applications in public health, agriculture, and psychology. The second, {VFP}, is a more specialised package that uses {gnm} to model the mean-variance relationship for in-vitro diagnostic assays.

      Through these use cases we'll see how different features of {gnm} can be applied, demonstrating the versatility of this software.
