keynote-title: On Finding Good Experiments
keynote-abstract: |
  One of the key choices we have as scientists is to design informative experiments. With computational methods like AI promising accurate predictions, we revisit the question of adaptively designing new measurements that take previous data into account. Using examples from genomics, we illustrate some recent ideas on using machine learning to recommend experiments. Then we discuss potential impacts on choosing measurements in spatiotemporal problems. We conclude by outlining some opportunities and challenges of including machine learning in the scientific discovery process.
