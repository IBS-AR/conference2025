 Jesse Goodman is a Senior Lecturer in Statistics at the University of Auckland. He began his academic career in mathematical probability, using distributional approximations and large deviations techniques to understand random geometric structures, and increasingly looking at statistical models that exhibit probabilistic complexity. His research focuses on asymptotic techniques, particularly when several asymptotic effects interact or compete, in areas from branching processes and spatial structures to approximations for likelihoods and densities. Recent work on saddlepoint approximations has helped to quantify the degree to which approximation techniques can deliver valid inferential conclusiosn, and to extend classes of models to capture real-life complexity in capture-recapture and other settings that feature enigmatic sensor data.
keynote-title: Saddlepoint approximations for likelihoods
keynote-abstract: |
  Classically, the saddlepoint approximation has been used as a systematic method for converting a known generating function into an approximation for an unknown density function. More recently, it has been used instead as an approximation to the *likelihood function*. In this viewpoint, it is the underlying data-generating process whose generating function is used, and the saddlepoint approximation can be maximized to compute an approximate saddlepoint MLE for given observed data. This talk will explain how the saddlepoint approximation can be interpreted with a statistical lens, including common features for those otherwise intractable models where we can compute a generating function but not a likelihood. Many of these models come from statistical ecology, including sitations where we gather population-wide observations only. In addition, the talk will describe a class of models having simple theoretical guarantees for the effect of using the saddlepoint MLE as a substitute for the unknown true MLE, and will demonstrate new tools to visualize the saddlepoint approximation intuitively, to simplify and automate the computation of saddlepoint MLEs, and to quantitatively assess the amount of approximation error introduced by using an approximate likelihood as a substitute for an intractable true likelihood.
