keynote-title: Modularizing Biometric Models Facilitates Multistage Computing
keynote-abstract: |
  Bayesian modeling has become invaluable in biometrics.  It allows us to formally consider unobserved processes while accommodating uncertainty about data collection and our understanding of biological and ecological mechanisms.  Several excellent software packages are available for fitting Bayesian models to data and are being applied every day to analyze biometric data.  These methods allow us to answer questions using data in ways that has never before been possible.  The adoption of Bayesian methods has led to bigger models necessary to answer tough questions using large and varied data sets.  Bigger models and data sets lead to computing bottlenecks.  Fortunately, a solution to Bayesian computing roadblocks sits in plain sight.  The structure of Bayesian models allows us to rearrange them so that we can perform computing in stages.  We can break big models into pieces, fit them separately, and then recombine them in later computing stages.  Recursive Bayesian approaches can save us time by leveraging the parallel architecture of modern computers.  A modular perspective allows us to see Bayesian models in a way that facilitates multistage computing.  I will demonstrate the procedure with a set of biometric examples.  These include geostatistical models in marine science, capture-recapture models for abundance estimation, and spatial point process models for species distributions.
