## Generalized Nonlinear Models in R

By **Heather Turner**

24th November 2025, 9AM-5PM

The class of generalized linear models covers several methods commonly used in data analysis, including multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and log-linear models. But a linear predictor does not always capture the relationship we wish to model. Rather, a nonlinear predictor may provide a better description of the observed data, often with fewer and more interpretable parameters. This workshop introduces the wider class of generalized nonlinear models (GNMs) and their implementation via the R package gnm. The day will begin with a brief refresher of linear and generalized linear models. The extension to a nonlinear predictor will be motivated by the case of structured interaction models, such as Goodman's Row-Column association model for contingency tables. The remainder of the day will be devoted to further applications, such as the UNIDIFF models for social mobility data, the Lee-Carter model for mortality data, and bespoke GNMs.

## Requirements

Participants should bring a laptop with R installed, along with the `gnm`, `logmult` and `vcdExtra` packages.


## Registration 

The registration for the workshop will open in June. The workshop is limited in space so please register early to secure your spot.
