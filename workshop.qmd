### Generalized Nonlinear Models in R

By **Heather Turner**

<details>

- **Date and Time**: 24th November 2025, 9AM-5PM

- **Location**: At or close to National Film and Sound Archive

The class of generalized linear models covers several methods commonly used in data analysis, including multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and log-linear models. But a linear predictor does not always capture the relationship we wish to model. Rather, a nonlinear predictor may provide a better description of the observed data, often with fewer and more interpretable parameters. This workshop introduces the wider class of generalized nonlinear models (GNMs) and their implementation via the R package gnm. The day will begin with a brief refresher of linear and generalized linear models. The extension to a nonlinear predictor will be motivated by the case of structured interaction models, such as Goodman's Row-Column association model for contingency tables. The remainder of the day will be devoted to further applications, such as the UNIDIFF models for social mobility data, the Lee-Carter model for mortality data, and bespoke GNMs.

#### Requirements

Participants should

- bring a laptop with R installed, along with the `gnm`, `logmult` and `vcdExtra` packages.
- have basic R knowledge (e.g. you have used R to load data, create simple visualisations, perform basic analyses and write simple functions or more specifically, you are familiar with concepts in [Cookbook for R by Winston Chang](http://www.cookbook-r.com/))
- know basic statistics (e.g. simple linear regression, hypothesis testing, basic summary statistics and plots)

#### Desirable

Familiarity with:

- generalized linear models and/or
- nonlinear least squares models

would be beneficial but not essential.

#### Biography

Heather is an Associate Professor and EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow in the Statistics Department at the University of Warwick, UK. She has over 20 years of experience in the development of statistical code and software, gained through positions in academia, industry, and as a freelance consultant. In research, she has developed a portfolio of R packages for statistical modelling and collaborated on applications in sports, social science and agriculture. In her work with industry, she has specialised in applications in pharmaceutical R&D, with companies including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Roche. Heather is active in community management and engagement among R users and developers. She is on the board of the R Foundation and chairs the R Contribution Working Group (fostering the community of contributors to the R project) and the R Forwards taskforce (widening the participation of under-represented groups in the R community).

### Analysing Complex Survey and Subsample Data (with R)

By **Thomas Lumley**

<details>

- **Date and Time**: 24th November 2025, 9AM-5PM

- **Location**: At or close to National Film and Sound Archive

Modelling data from complex sampling designs such as multistage surveys or case-cohort designs used to require specialised expertise and software (and even hardware).  In the modern world, commodity computers, free software, internet data distribution and the unifying ideas of weighting and influence functions mean that anyone can analyse datasets like these, and relatively little expertise is needed.  This workshop is designed to provide a basis for doing your own analyses.  We will cover

- the basic features of sampling: strata, clusters, sampling probabilities
- describing sampling to R
- summary statistics and graphics for survey data
- regression modelling for survey data
- calibration/raking of weights to use population or full-cohort information
- efficiency/robustness issues in weighted estimation

The workshop will alternate between presentations by me and exercises for you to work on.



#### Requirements

Assumes some experience using R, though we won't need any advanced programming, and knowledge of regression modelling at an advanced undergraduate level.  You will need a laptop with R, the survey package, and the svyVGAM package installed.

#### Biography

Thomas Lumley is a Professor in the Statistics Department at the University of Auckland and Affiliate Professor at the University of Washington.  He is the developer of the 'survey' package for R and author of "Complex Surveys: A Guide to Analysis Using R" (Wiley, 2010). Thomas has given workshops on R or surveys in 13 different time zones.
